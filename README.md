# Freqtrade Strategies Repository

Repository that organizes freqtrade strategies and configurations. 

## Results
The structure is `results > dry-run/live > strategy > exchange > config`  
- On the **strategy** folder you can find the .py file and a README with information about that strategy.  
- On the **config** folder you will find the .json file, a README with information about that configuration, and the <ins>results</ins>.

## Overall
For each strategy there should be dry-run and live results published. Just follow the path ;)
